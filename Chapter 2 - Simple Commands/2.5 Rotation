To rotate right, use the command:
tello.rotate_clockwise(90) # this command will rotate the drone 90 degree in a clockwise direction

To do full rotation to the right, use the command:
tello.rotate_clockwise(360) # this command will do full rotation in a clockwise direction

To do full rotation to the left, use the command:
tello.rotate_counter_clockwise(360) # this command will do full rotation in a counter clockwise direction

We can also custom the degree as desired, by using these commands:
tello.rotate_clockwise(x) # this command will rotate the drone x degree in a clockwise direction

tello.rotate_counter_clockwise(x) # this command will rotate the drone x degree in a clockwise direction
