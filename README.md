# Introduction

A drone which is also regarded as an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is an aircraft consisting of no human pilot on board, hence the name ‘unmanned’. Drones are controlled through a ground-based controller constructed through a computerised program. In this case, the program can be manufactured by various different methods. In accordance with the module, the method incorporated to control a drone constructed by an assembled program embraces the role of Python as a route to articulate the user’s vision towards a drone. Python as a programming language, is a simple yet efficient method that supports the applied purpose of the module. The module is composed by various clear instructions and guided tutorials to usher the reader/user towards a similar goal. In spite of what preceded, the devised module has gone through trials and errors to ensure the user may receive the best results in achieving the concordant purpose of drone programming.
