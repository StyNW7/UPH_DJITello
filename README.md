## Introduction

A drone which is also regarded as an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is an aircraft consisting of no human pilot on board, hence the name ‘unmanned’. Drones are controlled through a ground-based controller constructed through a computerised program. In this case, the program can be manufactured by various different methods. In accordance with the module, the method incorporated to control a drone constructed by an assembled program embraces the role of Python as a route to articulate the user’s vision towards a drone. Python as a programming language, is a simple yet efficient method that supports the applied purpose of the module. The module is composed by various clear instructions and guided tutorials to usher the reader/user towards a similar goal. In spite of what preceded, the devised module has gone through trials and errors to ensure the user may receive the best results in achieving the concordant purpose of drone programming.

## Chapter I (Installation)

This chapter will cover all the extensions you need to build your drone program. We will start by installing Python, Github, Copilot, Visual Studio Code, and PIP. These are all the essential items that must be downloaded in your laptop. In the next step, we will give you step by step on how to connect Copilot and Visual Studio Code to make your coding experience easier. 

## Chapter II (Simple Commands)

Now you are ready to fly your drone. In this chapter, you will discover many interesting movements your drone can make. Before that, it is important to learn about some commands that help you to import the Tello library, connect your Tello with python, take off, and landing.
